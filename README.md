# MNIST-CNN-Project
This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries, showcasing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation

#Project Structure
mnist_cnn.ipyb: The main file that includes data preparation, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction.
final_model.h5: The saved model after training and evaluation (not included in the repository, generated after running the jupternotebook).
